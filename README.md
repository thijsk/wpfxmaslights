# Project Description #

## What's this all about? ##
WPF Christmas Lights is a small application that decorates your windows desktop with blinking Christmas lights. By running these lights on your desktop you can enjoy the xmas atmosphere without leaving your PC!

## WHY? ##
Because it was possible...

## Installation ##
The easiest way to install the Christmas Lights is via the Click-Once installation page: http://www.brokenwire.net/ChristmasLights/publish.htm

## Does it run on my PC? ##
The lights work on any pc having the .NET Framework version 4 installed. This includes machines running Windows 7, Windows Vista and Windows XP. You don't need the full framework, the lightweight "client-profile" is enough.
